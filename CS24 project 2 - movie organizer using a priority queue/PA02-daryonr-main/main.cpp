/*
(step 0) The first while loop which reads in the movies and puts them into a priority queue. Overall, this has a O(n log n). This is because the while loop will have a worst case operating time of n times and the insert function of the priority queue will have an worst case operating time of O(log n). Multiplying these two together gives us the overall Big-O. 

Step 1 has a Big-O complexity of O(n log n). This is because there is a while loop which will iterate n times (O(n)). Within the while loop is a top(), O(1), and a pop() function, O(log n). Adding these two together and multiplying it by O(n) gives us the overall worst case running time of O(n log n). 

Step 2 has a Big-O of O(m n log k). This is because the beginning for loop will iterate for as many prefixes that are inputted (O(m)). Within the for loop is a while loop which will iterate throughout the entire movies list looking for a prefix match (O(n)). If there is a prefix match, there is a push() function O(log k) which will add it to a separate list. Multiplying these Big-Os together gives us an overall time complexity of O(m n log k).

Part b
Within the program there was a lot of additional space allocated as we needed multiple priority queues to sort and organize the data in addition to a container for the prefixes. For example, we needed separate priority queues to sort by rating (O(n)), alphabetical (O(n)) order, and prefix (O(m)). By combining together all the space complexities and reducing the coefficients, we get an overall space complexity of O(n + m). 

Part c
Our priority was a low time complexity with minor regard to space complexity. We simply wanted output speed to be quick. What ended up happening however was the opposite: we had an algorithm with a subpar time complexity but a good space complexity. Our high level implementation of our algorithm mentioned creating a priority queue with all the movies of the user-defined prefixes and then having a loop to cout all the movies in decreasing numerical order. It was estimated that the priority queue would take O(n) to make, and the loop to take o(logk) to run, therefore making a total time complexity of O(logk). However, we failed to consider how to loop through the m amount of prefixes and how exactly to fill in our priority queue, which contributed to a higher runtime than expected. These fine details in high level implementation werenâ€™t accounted for, which led to a higher-than-expected time complexity.
